# Container

The Container widget lets you create a rectangular visual element. A container can be decorated with a `BoxDecoration`, such as a background, a border, or a shadow. A Container can also have margins, padding, and constraints applied to its size. In addition, a Container can be transformed in three-dimensional space using a matrix.
