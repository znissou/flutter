# stack

Instead of being linearly oriented (either horizontally or vertically), a Stack widget lets you place widgets on top of each other in paint order. You can then use the `Positioned` widget on children of a Stack to position them relative to the top, right, bottom, or left edge of the stack. Stacks are based on the webâ€™s absolute positioning layout model.
